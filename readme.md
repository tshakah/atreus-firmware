# Atreus Firmware

This is the firmware for the [Atreus keyboard](https://github.com/technomancy/atreus).

This branch is specific to the Atreus variant that uses the
[A-Star Micro](http://www.pololu.com/product/3101). Earlier versions
used the [Teensy 2](http://pjrc.com/store/teensy.html); these should
use the `teensy2` branch of this repository.

## Usage

Install
[gcc-avr](http://www.nongnu.org/avr-libc/user-manual/install\_tools.html)
and [avrdude](http://www.nongnu.org/avrdude/).

On Debian-based systems:

    $ sudo apt-get install avrdude gcc-avr avr-libc

Some linux-based systems will need a udev rule to grant permissions to
the USB device for uploading firmware.

    $ sudo make udev

On Mac OS X with Homebrew:

    $ brew tap osx-cross/avr
    $ brew install avr-libc
    $ brew install avrdude --with-usb

If you don't want to use Homebrew you can instead download
[Crosspack for AVR](https://www.obdev.at/products/crosspack/index.html).

Run `make upload` with the keyboard plugged in, and then activate the
bootloader with reset (see below). Depending on your OS, it may expose
the USB device somewhere other than the default of `/dev/ttyACM0`; if
so you can run `make upload USB=/dev/cu.usbmodem1411` etc. If you idle
in the bootloader for 8 seconds without uploading, the controller will
exit the bootloader and return to normal operation.

If the upload does not complete, check the permissions on the USB
device and ensure it's writeable by your user. You may need to run
`sudo make udev` on some Linux-based systems to install a udev rule if
the permissions aren't right.

You can identify the USB device like so:

```
$ ls /dev > /tmp/dev-off # run this while the device is unplugged
$ ls /dev > /tmp/dev-on # run this while the device is in bootloader mode
$ diff /tmp/dev-off /tmp/dev-on
```

To use another C layout, copy it to `layout.h`; for example `cp
multidvorak.h layout.h`. To use a JSON layout, run `make jsonlayout
LAYOUT=softdvorak` and it will be written to `layout.h`.

Usually you won't be able to upload the firmware from a virtualized
OS; the virtualization interferes with the USB connection. However,
you can compile the `.hex` file on a virtualized OS and take the hex
file to a physical host and upload it with `avrdude` without
installing the full compiler toolchain.

## Windows

Start by installing the A-Star drivers, as
[documented by Pololu](https://www.pololu.com/docs/0J61/6.1). Once the
driver is installed and the device is plugged in, you can determine
the correct port setting by resetting the controller and looking at
the "Ports (COM & LPT)"
[section of the Windows Device Manager](https://a.pololu-files.com/picture/0J5272.500.png);
it should show up as "Pololu A-Star Micro 32U4" if you check within 8
seconds of initiating a reset.

You can install the whole development toolchain using
[WinAVR](http://winavr.sourceforge.net/) to compile using `make upload
[...]` with the instructions above.

However, if the whole compiler setup is too complicated, it's also
possible to download a
[precompiled firmware](http://atreus.technomancy.us/atreus-qwerty.hex)
containing the default layout and uploading it with the simpler
[AVRDUDESS](http://blog.zakkemble.co.uk/avrdudess-a-gui-for-avrdude/).

These are the steps to using AVRDUDESS:

* pick "avr109" as the programmer
* select "ATmega32u4" from the MCU section in the upper left
* select the port in the upper left as found in the device manager
* choose the .hex file you downloaded in the "flash" section
* reset the microcontroller so that the LED is gently pulsing
* press "go" under "flash"

## Reset

If you've already got the firmware loaded on the controller, you
should have a key bound to reset; typically this is activated by
jumping to layer 2 (`fn`+`ESC`) and then hitting `enter`.

If your board has never before had
[the firmware uploaded](http://www.pololu.com/docs/0J61/5.3), you will
have to *hard reset* by connecting the `RST` pin to ground twice in
under a second to jump to the bootloader. (This requires removing the
back panel.)  For older models, `RST` and ground are exposed with
hookup wire poking out of the bottom of the board, but for newer
models they are the sixth and seventh pin down on the right-side row
of microcontroller pins. For first-time uploads, hit reset before
running `make upload`.

If you are hacking the lower-level logic of the firmware, the reset
key might not be reachable (due to bugs in layer functionality, etc)
and you will have to initiate a manual reset as per above with the `RST` pin.

Sometimes it can be tricky to get the timing right with the hard
reset; it can take a few attempts when you are first uploading the
firmware to a fresh board.

## Pinout

This is the pinout for the PCB-based Atreus using an A-Star
microcontroller. ([Mark 3](https://github.com/technomancy/atreus/blob/master/changelog.md)
onwards.) The Teensy 2 variants use a different pinout.

Outputs:

    |------------+----+----+----+----|
    | row number |  0 |  1 |  2 |  3 |
    |------------+----+----+----+----|
    | pin number | D0 | D1 | D3 | D2 |
    |------------+----+----+----+----|

Inputs:

    |---------------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----|
    | column number |  0 |  1 |  2 |  3 |  4 |  5 |  6 |  7 |  8 |  9 | 10 |
    |---------------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----|
    | pin number    | B7 | B6 | F7 | F6 | B6 | D4 | E6 | B4 | B5 | C6 | D7 |
    |---------------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----|

If you soldered the PCB in upside down, never fear! This can be fixed
in the firmware without removing the switches and resoldering. Simply
run `make SWAPCOLUMNS=yes USB=...` to use a reversed pinout
configuration.

## Layouts in C

Layouts in C are arrays of integers. For basic key presses, use the
keycodes defined in `usb_keyboard.h`. For modified key presses use the
`CTRL()`, `SHIFT()`, `ALT()` and `GUI()` macros from `atreus.c`. These
may be stacked for holding down multiple modifiers together. Layouts
can also include references to functions to execute. Place a `void`
function pointer in the `layout_functions` array and use the
`FUNCTION()` macro providing the index of the function, and that
keypress will cause the function to be invoked.

The `layouts` pointer should be set to an array of layouts. Every scan
through the keyboard matrix will set the current layout to the
`current_layout_number`th element of the `layouts` array. To make a
keybinding that changes the current layout use the `LAYER()` macro.

However, most functions will be called the final pass where each
keypress is looked up in the currently active layout. That means if
you have a function that changes the current layout, it needs to run
sooner so it can affect regular keycode lookups. The `PRE_FUNCTION()`
macro will trigger functions that run on a separate pre-invoke pass
before the rest of the keycodes are looked up, so this is how
layer-changing functions should be defined. There is also a
`per_cycle` function you can define which will run once per completed
scan.

## Layouts in JSON

See `qwerty.json` for an example.

The layout JSON should simply be a three-dimensional array. At the top
level, every array element is a layer. You can have up to 64
layers. Each layer is an array of rows, and each row is an array of
keycodes. A keycode can either be a keypress (described in
`usb_keyboard.h`), a keypress with a modifier (like `["shift", "7"]`
to insert a `&` character), `"fn"` to switch to layer 1 while held, or
`["layer", 0]` to switch to a given layer beyond while the key is
being held. It's also advised to include a `["reset"]` key as this is
used to program updates to the firmware without opening the case to
hit the hardware reset button. Finally, an empty string can be used to
indicate a keypress which does nothing.

The JSON layouts are parsed by the `atreus.el` code in Emacs. `M-x
atreus-make` will compile a given JSON file into a `.hex` file for
uploading, and `M-x atreus-view` will compile JSON into an HTML table
and open it in the browser. But the `jsonlayout` makefile target
automates this.

Alternatively there is a script `atreus-layout-to-svg.sh` that will
compile the json into HTML document with embedded SVG layouts. The
`jsonlayout` makefile target also automates this. 
(`atreus-layout-to-svg.sh` relies on sed and jq)

## How it works

Since the microcontroller has a limited number of pins, the switches
are wired in a matrix where each has its positive contact connected to
those in the same row and its negative contact wired in with those
above and below it. Reading the state of the switches can only happen
a row at a time: a single row (output) pin is brought low, and all the
column inputs are read. Any of them that read low are recorded as a
keypress. Low voltage is used to for pressed keys because each input
pin has a built-in pullup resistor.

However, because of the electrical properties of switches, it's
necessary to go through a
[debouncing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switch#Contact_bounce)
process as the switches settle. This means taking a few scans over the
matrix and waiting until you get N successive reads of the same state
before counting any single keypress or release as legitimate.

## Problems

There seem to be issues with [avrdude uploading the firmware from Ubuntu 14.04](https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/1380/sketches-not-uploading-to-micro-from-ubuntu-14-04).

Occasionally there are issues when switching layers that a key pressed
in one layer briefly sends a keycode for the layer you're switching
to. The
[TMK firmware](https://github.com/technomancy/tmk_keyboard/tree/atreus)
avoids this particular bug.
